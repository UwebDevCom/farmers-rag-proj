- Use `st.cache` to optimize performance by caching expensive computations
- Organize your app into clear sections using `st.header`, `st.subheader`, and `st.markdown`
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback with `st.error` and `st.success`
- Use `st.session_state` for maintaining state between interactions
- Keep your app modular by splitting logic into functions and importing them
