Building a RAG System with Python, Streamlit, and Pinecone
I'd be happy to help you create a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) project using Python, Streamlit, and Pinecone. Here's a comprehensive plan to guide you through the process:
Project Plan

1. Setup Environment

Install required Python packages
Configure your development environment
Set up API keys and credentials

2. Data Preparation

Implement file upload functionality
Extract text from different file formats
Preprocess the text data

3. Vector Database Integration

Connect to Pinecone
Create embeddings for your documents
Store vectors in Pinecone

4. RAG Implementation

Develop the retrieval mechanism
Integrate with an LLM (e.g., OpenAI)
Create the generation component

5. Streamlit UI Development
